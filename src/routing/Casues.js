          <h4>Greenhouse Gas Emissions:</h4>
          <p>
            The burning of fossil fuels (coal, oil, and natural gas) for energy
            is a significant contributor to the release of greenhouse gases
            (GHGs) such as carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous
            oxide (N2O) into the atmosphere. These gases trap heat and lead to a
            warming effect, known as the greenhouse effect.
          </p>
          <h4>Loss of Biodiversity</h4>
          <p>
            {" "}
            Climate change itself contributes to the loss of biodiversity as
            ecosystems struggle to adapt to changing conditions. Conversely, the
            loss of biodiversity, such as the decline of certain plant and
            animal species, can disrupt ecosystems and contribute to climate
            change.
          </p>
          <h4>Use of Non-Renewable Resources</h4>
          <p>
            Climate change itself contributes to the loss of biodiversity as
            ecosystems struggle to adapt to changing conditions. Conversely, the
            loss of biodiversity, such as the decline of certain plant and
            animal species, can disrupt ecosystems and contribute to climate
            change.
          </p>
          <h4>Waste Management</h4>
          <p>
            {" "}
            Improper disposal of organic waste in landfills produces methane.
            Additionally, the incineration of waste materials releases GHGs
          </p>
          <h4>Land Use Changes</h4>
          <p>
            {" "}
            Alterations in land use, such as urbanization and changes in
            agricultural practices, can impact the natural balance of ecosystems
            and contribute to climate change.
